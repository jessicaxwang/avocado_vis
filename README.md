# Avocado Vis
COMP177 Final Project

A visualization of American avocado consumption over four years (2016-2019) for 45 regions. 

Data was provided by the Hass Avocado Board, a group created to promote the consumption of Hass avocados, research nutrition and consumer behavior, and compile data for consumption across the US.

Find out how much avocado toast you'd need to *not* eat to buy a house!
